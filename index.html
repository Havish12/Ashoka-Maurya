       <p id="background">Ashoka's father's name is Bindusara Maurya, and his mother's name is Subhadrangi Maurya. Ashoka’s grandfather was the founder of the Mauryan empire. His father was the second emperor of Maurya. Ashoka was brought up as a slave, and was treated like one, even though his father was the emperor of India. Ashoka was treated like a slave because his father did not care about him. Ashoka had to teach himself how to fight in wars. Ashoka fought in a war that is known as the Kalinga war, in which he killed all 99 of his brothers (according to legend, Ashoka killed all 99 of his brothers so that he would be the one that was going to be ruling next.), so the throne was given to him. He was still bloodthirsty and cruel, and always wanted everything to be perfect for himself, and those who did not comply, were then either, killed instantly, or tortured in prison. This is what Ashoka was like before he started following Buddhism.</p>
